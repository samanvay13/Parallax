# Parallax Website

This project is a simple parallax website showcasing three basic shapes: a square, a circle, and a triangle. The shapes exhibit a zooming-in effect as the user scrolls through the page, creating an engaging and dynamic visual experience.

## Features 🌟

- **Parallax Scrolling**: Smooth scrolling effect for an immersive user experience.
- **Zooming Effect**: The shapes (square, circle, and triangle) gradually zoom in as the user scrolls.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Minimal Design**: Clean and simple layout to focus on the parallax effect.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
